HTML:-
HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. 
The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

CSS:-
CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. 
CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

PHP:-
PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor ) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language
that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
